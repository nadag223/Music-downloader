# 🎵 Media Downloader

A modern, dark-themed desktop GUI for downloading YouTube videos and playlists — built with **PyQt6** and **yt-dlp**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Single video & playlist download** — switch between modes with one click
- **Format selection** — MP3, AAC, M4A, FLAC, WAV, Opus, Vorbis, MP4, WebM, MKV, or auto-best
- **Video quality picker** — choose from 144p up to 4K when a video format is selected
- **Playlist selector dialog** — scan a playlist, check/uncheck individual tracks, and rename them before downloading
- **Live progress bar & log** — real-time feedback with an animated status indicator
- **Stop anytime** — gracefully cancel mid-download without corrupting files
- **Custom output folder** — browse or type a path; defaults to `~/Media`
